    "There is about 115 million cars that hit the road everyday. Inside each car is a driver who has their motivations to get places safely. As we innovate and adopt new technologies into our automobiles it has definetly gotten safer to drive. However accidents are still very much a sobering reminder of the dangers that still exist every time we make that trip. In order to limit risks on ourselves we require training for all drivers, wear seatbelts and drive carefully based on weather and road conditions."
